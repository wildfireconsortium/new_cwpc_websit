        <div class="question">Q: How do I interpret the Scorecard?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>A: The Summary Scores sheet helps you compare various parameters/ essentials for wildfire prevention allowing 
            \you to identify areas where improvement is required. The chart offers visual comparision of the 10 essential 
            parameters for holistic understanding of the current evaluation and better planning for disaster resilience.</p>
          <p>The Scorecard may direct attention to issues that a community cannot immediately control â€“ for example, 
            utility-owned energy or water systems, or the stance of neighboring communities towards preparing for resilience. 
            However, if those issues affect the disaster resilience of the community, they need to be planned for even if, 
            in the short term, they cannot be corrected. In the longer term, they become subjects for discussions, negotiations, 
            advocacy, lobbying and legislation and working through industry associations to bring about the necessary changes.</p>
